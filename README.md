# Mens en Maatschappij 100 Jaar

This repository commemorates the centennial anniversary of *Mens en Maatschappij*, a prominent Dutch journal dedicated to sociology and social sciences. Established in 1925, the journal has been a cornerstone in disseminating sociological research and insights in the Netherlands.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`code/`**: Contains scripts used for data analysis and visualization related to the journal's publications over the past century.

- **`data/`**: Includes datasets extracted from the journal's archives, such as publication metadata, and author information.

- **`figures/`**: Houses visual representations, including graphs and charts, illustrating various analytical insights derived from the data.

- **`tables/`**: Contains tabular data summarizing key metrics and findings from the analyses.

## Objectives

This project aims to produce reproducible, time‑series indicators on:

1. **Publication volume by year** — Count articles published per year and identify long‑term trends and notable inflection points.
2. **Paper length over time** — Compute and track the average number of pages per article by year (with dispersion statistics) to detect shifts in article length.
3. **Most‑published authors** — Rank authors by number of publications and summarize their active periods.
4. **Topical change** — Map how published topics evolve across decades, highlighting emerging and declining themes.
5. **Methodological trends** — Classify and quantify research methods (e.g., qualitative, quantitative, mixed‑methods) and track changes over time.

## Getting Started

To explore the analyses:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
